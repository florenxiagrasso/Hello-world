# Hello-world
first repository
Hi !
my name is Florencia, I live in Buenos Aires, 
I'm a code newbie and I'm currently taking the admission course at the University 
to study Web development next year!
from now on I'm looking forward to start building projects and sharing my coding path 
with you all in this platform. I'm excited!
